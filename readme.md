# Fruit Classification Using CNN

A deep learning project that uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to classify **36 different fruit types** from images.  
The system is trained on a curated dataset and deployed as an interactive **Streamlit web application** for real-time fruit recognition.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project implements a CNN-based image classification model capable of identifying fruit types from images.  
The dataset contains **36 fruit classes**, with training and testing sets pre-organized.  
The model is trained using **TensorFlow/Keras** and deployed with **Streamlit** for easy user interaction.

**Example Fruit Classes:**
- Apple Braeburn  
- Avocado  
- Banana  
- Blueberry  
- Pineapple  
*(and 31 more...)*
